Ad-hoc Data Analysis :
The Czechoslovakia Bank wants to analyse its financial data to gain insights and make informed decisions. The bank needs to identify trends, patterns, and potential risks in its financial operations. They also want to explore the possibility of introducing new financial products or services based on their analysis.

The bank has identified the following questions as important for their analysis:

What is the demographic profile of the bank's clients and how does it vary across districts?
How the banks have performed over the years. Give their detailed analysis year & month-wise.
What are the most common types of accounts and how do they differ in terms of usage and profitability?
Which types of cards are most frequently used by the bank's clients and what is the overall profitability of the credit card business?
What are the major expenses of the bank and how can they be reduced to improve profitability?
What is the bankâ€™s loan portfolio and how does it vary across different purposes and client segments?
How can the bank improve its customer service and satisfaction levels?
Can the bank introduce new financial products or services to attract more customers and increase profitability?
The objective of this analysis is to provide the Czechoslovakia Bank with actionable insights that can help them make informed decisions about their financial operations. The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modelling to identify patterns and trends in the data.
